# CodeDiggerFrontendTask1
1. You will be provided with a dataset of user(data). 
2. You will have to organize the data in form of table, like this
3. Then you will have to implement filter options, where we can filter users using
names and other attributes.
4. The task should be done strictly using ReactJS.

Performed various operations on the data set provided such as Sorting on the basis of column, global searching, local searching, filtering on the basis of columns like which column do we want, provided a button to sort the column in ascending or descending order, did pagination, column hiding and various other operations.
I would like to thank Codevolution youtube channel for all the tutorials on react table.
This project can be viewed by running local host on pc. Currently all the functions have been implemented but you can edit the app.js file and change it according to your use.
